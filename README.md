# Country Capital Quiz

Welcome to the Country Capital Quiz project! This application is designed to help users learn about the capitals of various countries through an interactive quiz format.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `data/country_capitals.csv`: This file contains the dataset for the country capitals. Each row includes the country name, its capital, and any fun facts associated with that country or capital. Multiple rows can be used for a country if there are several fun facts.
  
- `src/main.py`: This is the main script for the quiz application. It handles loading the dataset, presenting questions to the user, and checking answers.

## Dataset Format

The `country_capitals.csv` file is structured as follows:

- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Capital**: The capital city of the country.
- **Fun Fact**: Interesting facts about the country or its capital. There can be multiple entries for a single country if there are several fun facts.
